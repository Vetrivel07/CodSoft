## Internship Projects at Codsoft

I completed an internship at Codsoft, where I worked on various tasks and projects to enhance my skills and knowledge. This repository contains the details of the tasks I completed during my internship.

## Tasks and Projects:

### Task 1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
- Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
### Task 3 - IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
- The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
### Task 4 - SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
- Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

## About the Internship:
